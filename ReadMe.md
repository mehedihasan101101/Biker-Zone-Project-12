## Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI Integration

### **Tailwind CSS**
Tailwind CSS is used extensively for styling the project. It provides utility classes for:

- **Spacing**: `p-6`, `mt-10`, `gap-3`
- **Typography**: `text-[25px]`, `font-bold`
- **Flexbox/Grid**: `flex`, `grid`, `justify-between`
- **Colors**: `bg-[#E76F51]`, `text-[#23A6F0]`

### **Daisy UI**
Daisy UI is used for pre-styled components, making the development process faster and easier. Examples include:

- **Navbar**: `navbar bg-base-100`
- **Buttons**: `btn bg-[#E76F51] text-white`
- **Cards**: `card bg-base-100 shadow-sm`
- **Accordion**: `collapse collapse-arrow`
